# Pathfinding-Algorithms-Visualizer
IF YOU USE MY CODE FOR YOUR PROJECT, IT IS NOT REQUIRED BY LICENSE BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE CREDIT :)
This is my Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer, I have created this while teaching myself React and plan on working this into an interactive, education website in the future. In the case that I do this, I will implement other algorithms such as sorting algorithms. Until then here is a link to my website that runs the current build of this project.
